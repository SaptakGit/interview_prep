# Introduction 
    Note - Redux is not mandatory to use in our application. When we build large-scale applications where we 
    have to manage the state of a lot of components and the application has a number of features, then using  
    Redux in our application makes sense. In small-scale or mid-scale applications, we can still manage the 
    state without using Redux. Redux and React both are not the same thing. Redux is not part of React. They 
    both are different libraries. All the applications built using Redux can also be built without using it.  
    Redux is not the only library for state management. There is also another library named Zustand.  
    Just like we have React Dev Tools, we also have Redux Dev Tools which help us to debug our application when we use Redux.  
    There are 2 libraries that Redux team offers:  
        1. react-redux: This is like a bridge between React and Redux.  
        2. Redux toolkit: This is a newer way of writing redux. This package is intended to be the standard way of writing Redux logic. 
    Redux Store is like a very big JavaScript object, which has a lot of data in it, stored in a global central space. 

    Is it a good idea to store all the data in one place ? Yes 
     
    Since the Redux store contains a lot of data, we do not want it to become very big, so we make use of  Slices  
    offered  by Redux. We can assume slice as a small portion of Redux store. We can create multiple slices 
    in our store. To keep data separate, we create logical partitions in our store. These partitions are known as 
    Slices. If we want to keep the data related to the cart, then we will create a separate slice for the cart. 
    If we want to keep the data related to the logged in user, then we will create a separate slice for that as well. 
    Redux says that we cannot directly modify the data in the slice. Redux offers a way to do that. Assume that we 
    have a cartSlice which keeps track of the data in the cart. We have an Add to cart button which adds the item into the cart.
    By clicking on this button, we cannot directly modify our cartSlice. To modify the cartSlice, when the user clicks on 
    the Add To Cart button, we have to dispatch an action. When we dispatch an action, it calls a function and then this 
    function modifies the cart. Here is the flow: 

        User clicks the button —> Dispatch an action —> Action calls a function —> Function modifies the cart slice.

    The function which is being called by the action is known as Reducer Function. 
    
    So when the user clicks the button, it dispatches an action. This action calls the reducer function and this 
    reducer function updates the slice. 


# This was about writing the data into the store. How to read data from the store ? 

    Suppose I want to show the count of items in the cart on my navigation bar. We can read the data from the 
    store by something known as  Selectors. When we use a selector to read the data, this phenomenon is known as 
    Subscribing to the store. So we can say that the navigation bar is subscribed to our store. That means the 
    navigation bar will alway be in sync with the store. If the  data in the store (cart slice in this case) changes, 
    then the data shown  on the navigation bar will also change. 


    
    
# Install Redux 
    npm install @reduxjs/toolkit  
    npm install react-redux 

# Create/Configure the store 

    import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

    const appStore = configureStore({});

    export default appStore

# Providing the store to the application 

        import { Provider } from "react-redux"
        import appStore from "./appStore"

        const App = () => {
            return(
                <provider store={appStore}>
                    <Header />
                    <Body />
                </Provider>
            )
        }

        export default App;

    ● Configuring the store is Redux’s job. That’s why we imported configureStore from @reduxjs/toolkit.  
    ● Providing this store to the application is the job of react-redux. That’s why we imported Provider from react-redux. 
    ● We then use this <Provider></Provider> as a wrapper to wrap our application inside it. 
    ● Provider takes a property store to which we can assign our configured store. 

# Create a slice 

        import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

        const cartSlice = createSlice({
            name: "cart",
            initialState: {
                items: [],
            },
            reducers:{
                addItem: (state, action) => {
                    state.items.push(action.payload);
                },
            },
        });

        export const { addItem } = cartSlice.actions;
        export default cartSlice.reducer;

    ● createSlice() returns an object which has following properties: 
        ○ Name 
        ○ Initial state 
        ○ Reducers 
    ● The initialState is the state which a slice has in the beginning before it gets modified. 
    ● Reducers have actions and these actions have callback functions. 
    ● addItem is a reducer function which is called as an action  . 
    ● The function which is assigned to it is responsible for modifying or updating the cartSlice. 
    ● We have exported the reducer as a default export. 
    ● We have also exported the actions from the slice. 
    ● The payload of the action will contain a new item in this case which will be pushed to the items array in the state. 

# Add the slice to the store 

        import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
        import { cartReducer } from "./utlis/cartSlilce";

        const appStore = configureStore({
            reducer : {
                cart: cartReducer,
            }
        });

        export default appStore

    ● The reducer key is assigned with an object which will have all the slices (cartSlice in this case). 
    ● The reducer contains the slices where each of the slices contains its own reducer functions. 

# Subscribing to the store 
    ● We can subscribe to the store using a selector to read the data  of the store. 
    ● Redux offers a hook named useSelector which can be  used to subscribe to the store. 

        import React from "react"
        import { useSelector } from "react-redux"

        const Cart = () => {
            const cartItems = useSelector((store) => store.cart.items);

            return(
                <div>
                    <h1>
                        {cartItems.length}
                    </h1>
                </div>
            )
        }

        export default cart

    ● This useSelector gives us access to the store where we can find the cart.items. 
    ● The items of the cart will be stored in cartItems  which we can use in our component. 
    ● Note - Make sure to access a particular state variable. In our case, we have accessed cart.items 
        which gives us the exact value of items. 
    ● If we subscribe only to store.cart, sometimes this store.cart may contain state variables other than items. 
    ● If there is a change in any of those state variables, then it will re-render the  cart component as well. 
    ● So subscribing only to store.cart.items will make the Cart component re-render only when there is a change in the items. 

# Dispatch an action 

        import React from "react"
        import { useDispatch } from "react-redux"
        import { addItem } from "./utlis/cartSlice"

        const Body = () => {

            const dispatch = useDispatch();

            const haldlAddItem = () => {
                dispatch(addItem("Apple"));
            }

            return(
                <div>
                    <button onClick={haldlAddItem}>Add Item</button>
                </div>
            )
        }

        export default Body

    ● React-redux offers a hook to dispatch an action i.e. useDispatch. This hook returns a function i.e. dispatch(). 
    ● The dispatch() function takes an argument i.e. addItem action. 
    ● The addItem action has a reducer function which takes one argument i.e. payload (apple). 
    ● When an action is dispatched, an object is created. This object has a key i.e. payload and it will have the value 
        which is passed to the reducer function i.e. apple.  
    ● {  
        Payload: “apple”,  
      } 
    ● The handleAddItem will be responsible for dispatching the action  and it is assigned to the click event 
        of the button. So whenever the user clicks the button, the addItem action will be dispatched and it will add that item to the cart. 
    
        onClick={handleAddItem} vs onClick={() => handleAddItem(item)} vs onClick={handleAddItem(item)}  
    
        1. onClick={handleAddItem} 
            a. This syntax assigns the handleAddItem function directly to the onClick event.
            b. When the button is clicked, the handleAddItem function will be called without any arguments. 

        2. onClick={() => handleAddItem(item)} 
            a. This syntax uses an arrow function to call handleAddItem with the item argument.
            b. This is useful when you need to pass specific arguments to the handleAddItem function when the button is clicked.
            c. Here, the item needs to be defined or in scope when the button is rendered.  
            d. If item is a variable available in the component’s context, it will be passed to handleAddItem when the button is clicked. 

        3. onClick={handleAddItem(item)} 
            a. This syntax is incorrect and will not work as expected. 
            b. Here, handleAddItem(item) is immediately invoked when the component renders, rather than being set as a callback to 
                be invoked on the click event.
            c. The return value of handleAddItem(item) (which is typically undefined unless the function returns another function) 
                will be assigned to onClick.
            d. To properly call handleAddItem with an argument when the button is clicked, you should wrap it in an anonymous function, 
                like in the second example.  
 
    In older redux (vanilla redux), it was not allowed to mutate the state. We used to create a copy of our state and then modify that. 
    We also had to return the new state. This whole process is still done by Redux behind the scenes but now it is not asking developers 
    to do it. Redux is using the immer library to do it. In the new redux, we have to mutate the state. And it is not mandatory 
    to return the state as well.
