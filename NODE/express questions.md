# 1.What is Express.js?
    Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js. 
    According to the MDN Documents "Express is a popular unopinionated web framework, written in JavaScript and 
    hosted within the Node.js runtime environment."
# 2.How do you create a simple server using Express.js?
    // Import Express
    const express = requie('express');
    const app = express();
    
    // Define a route
    app.get("/", (req, res)=>{
      res.send("Welcome to Express Js");
    })
 
    // Start the server
    app.listion(3000, ()=>{
      console.log("Server is running on Port 3000");
    }) 
    

# 3.What is middleware in Express.js?
    Middleware in Express refers to functions that process requests before reaching the route handlers. These functions 
    can modify the request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function. 
    Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined. They can perform tasks like authentication, logging, 
    or error handling.
    Syntax:
        app.use((req, res, next) => {
            console.log('Middleware executed');
            next();
        });
        (req, res, next) => {}: This is the middleware function where you can perform actions on the request and response objects 
                                before the final handler is executed.
        next(): This function is called to pass control to the next middleware in the stack if the current one doesnâ€™t end the 
                request-response cycle.

    Types of Middleware:
        1. Application-level Middleware
        2. Router-level Middleware
        3. Error-handling Middleware
        4. Built-in Middleware
        5. Third-party Middleware
